### Analysis of new wells

Our task was to decide where to drill a new well for GlavRosGosNeft.  
1. We studied the exploration of three regions and checked the data.  
2. We trained and tested a linear regression model for each of the regions.  
3. Next, we ran the Bootstrap procedure and found the average return, 95% confidence interval, and risk of loss.  

As a result, we chose one of the regions, where we found the highest average profit and the lowest risk for well development.

**KEYWORDS**: Python, Stats, Linear Regression, Profit vs Risk analysis
